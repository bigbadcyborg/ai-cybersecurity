TODO:
  <br>-Utilize git diff
  <br>-Prevent Cloned websites with detection of watering hole/pharming attacks (setoolkit)
  <br>-Non-kernel level AV vs. kernel-level AV and risks for both? prevent rootkits
  <br>-Prevent covert channels
  <br>-Prevent shellcode
  <br>-Prevent spyware
  <br>-Prevent cryptomalware
  <br>-Fileless virus
  <br>-Protect process images on persistent storage
  <br>-Deny new persistence processes
  <br>-Prevent script and macro viruses ("live off the land")- the malware uses the programming features available in local scripting <br>engines for the OS and/or browser, such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), JavaScript, Microsoft Office documents with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code enabled, or PDF documents with JavaScript enabled.
  <br>-Prevent tracking cookies
  <br>-Prevent "supercookies" -  A supercookie is a means of storing tracking data in a non-regular way, such as saving it to a cache without declaring the data to be a cookie or encoding data into header requests. A beacon is a single-pixel image embedded into a website. While invisible to the user, the browser must request to download the pixel to load the site, giving the beacon host the opportunity to collect metadata, perform browser fingerprinting, and potentially run tracking scripts.
  <br>-Prevent keyloggers. Keyloggers are not only implemented as software. A malicious script can transmit key presses to a third-party website. There are also hardware devices to capture key presses to a modified USB adapter inserted between the keyboard and the port. 

  <br><br>Basic Methods of Prevention:
  <br>-Latest version of browsers
  <br>-Latest patches
  <br>-Intricate Firewall
  <br>-Pop-up blocker
  <br>-Cookie Control
  <br>-Regular Scans
  <br>-Quarantine or delete software
  <br>-Block ICMP pings
